# AI Performance Optimization Content Enhancement Plan

## Original Prompt
"what google searches would someone make to answer the question 'how do i automatically start optimizing my tokens, picking the right model (so many models!), caching results to spend less'? Document and implement a plan to generate SEO articles pages in the learning center (/learn) to match those searches; use the search text as the page slug and the article title. The article should answer the question (or implied question) posed by the search term"
