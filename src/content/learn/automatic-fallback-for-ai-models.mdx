AI models and APIs can fail unexpectedly. Automatic fallback ensures your application continues to work by switching to a backup model or provider.

## What is Automatic Fallback?

Automatic fallback is logic that detects a failure and immediately tries an alternative model or provider, often without user intervention.

## When to Use Fallback
- Provider downtime or API errors
- Rate limiting or quota exhaustion
- Model-specific bugs or degraded performance

## Fallback Logic Patterns

### 1. Sequential Fallback
Try providers in order until one succeeds.

```python
def fallback_generate(prompt, model, providers):
    for provider in providers:
        try:
            return provider.generate(prompt, model)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Provider {provider} failed: {e}")
    raise Exception("All providers failed")
```

### 2. Parallel Fallback (Race)
Send requests to multiple providers and use the first successful response.

```python
import concurrent.futures

def parallel_fallback(prompt, model, providers):
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        futures = [executor.submit(p.generate, prompt, model) for p in providers]
        for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):
            try:
                return future.result()
            except Exception:
                continue
    raise Exception("All providers failed")
```

### 3. Fallback with Degraded Service
If all providers fail, return a cached or default response.

```python
def fallback_with_cache(prompt, model, providers, cache):
    try:
        return fallback_generate(prompt, model, providers)
    except Exception:
        return cache.get(prompt, "Service temporarily unavailable.")
```

## Real-World Example

Many production AI apps use fallback:
- Chatbots that switch from GPT-4 to Claude or Gemini if OpenAI is down
- Image generators that use a backup model if the primary fails
- Search engines that degrade gracefully to cached results

## Best Practices
- Monitor and log all fallback events
- Alert your team if fallback is triggered frequently
- Test fallback logic regularly
- Inform users if degraded service is used

## Conclusion
Automatic fallback is essential for robust AI applications. By implementing sequential, parallel, or degraded fallback, you can keep your app running even when models "bug out".
