# AI Model Reliability Best Practices

Ensuring AI model reliability is critical for production systems. Here are proven best practices to maximize uptime and minimize failures.

## 1. Monitor Everything
- Track model/API health, latency, and error rates
- Use dashboards and alerts for anomalies
- Log all requests and failures for analysis

## 2. Redundancy & Multi-Provider
- Use multiple providers or models for critical tasks
- Implement automatic failover and fallback logic
- Regularly test redundancy by simulating failures

## 3. Robust Error Handling
- Catch and log all exceptions
- Use retries with exponential backoff for transient errors
- Provide user-friendly error messages and degraded service if needed

## 4. Deployment & Versioning
- Use canary or blue/green deployments for new models
- Roll back quickly if a new model version causes issues
- Keep previous model versions available for fallback

## 5. SLA & Uptime Management
- Define clear SLAs for model uptime and response time
- Monitor SLA compliance and report on incidents
- Communicate transparently with users about outages

## Example: Monitoring with Prometheus

```python
# Pseudocode for monitoring AI model health
from prometheus_client import Gauge
model_health = Gauge('ai_model_health', 'Health of AI model', ['provider'])

def check_health(provider):
    # ... check provider health ...
    healthy = True  # or False
    model_health.labels(provider=provider).set(1 if healthy else 0)
```

## Conclusion
Reliability is a process, not a one-time fix. By monitoring, building in redundancy, handling errors gracefully, and deploying carefully, you can ensure your AI models deliver consistent, reliable resultsâ€”even when things "bug out".
