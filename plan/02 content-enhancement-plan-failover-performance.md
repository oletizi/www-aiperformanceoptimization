# AI Model Failover & Performance Reliability Content Enhancement Plan

## Original Prompt
"what google searches would someone make to answer the question 'how do I ensure failover / performance when models bug out so often'? Document (in the 'plan' directory) and implement a plan to generate SEO articles pages in the learning center (/learn) to match those searches; use the search text as the page slug and the article title. The article should answer the question (or implied question) posed by the search term. As steps in this plan are completed, record their completion in place, including relevant links to articles. Also update the /learn index page with links to any new articles in the relevant categories."
